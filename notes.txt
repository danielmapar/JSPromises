Resolved/Fulfilled: It worked 
Rejected: It didn't work
Pending: Still waiting...
Settled: Something happened (resolved or rejected)

	- Promise created
	- FREEZE TIME (could block the browser rendering)
	- Promise settled

Web workers work in a separated thread, and post data to the main thread (async and perfect for promises)
